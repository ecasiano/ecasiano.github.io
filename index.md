I am a Physics PhD Student at University of Tennessee Knoxville and doing an internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I'm fascinated by computational methods and their applicability in, not just physics, but almost any field.

For my PhD project, I developed a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation to compute the quantum entanglement entropies for systems of bosons at zero temperature.

At Los Alamos National Laboratory, I have been exploring how a type of machine learning model known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) performs better at simulating quantum many-body systems than some types of Monte Carlo simulations.

When not doing science, I enjoy playing viola, an instrument that I've played profesionally and leisurely since 2005 (when I was 12 years old). I'm also a big fan of reading, in particular magical realism novels, biographical and historical, science fiction, and self-improvement books.

Originally, I am from Puerto Rico, which is my favorite place in the world, and enjoy exploring the island and spending time with my family there.
