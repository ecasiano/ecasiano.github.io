I am a Physics PhD Student at University of Tennessee Knoxville and doing an internshiop at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I'm fascinated by computational methods and their applicability in varios fields, not just physics. 

For my PhD project, I developed a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation to compute the quantum entanglement entropies for systems of bosons at zero temperature.

At Los Alamos National Laboratory, I have been exploring how a type of machine learning model known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) may perform better at simulating quantum many-body systems than some types of Monte Carlo simulations.
