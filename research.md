# Quantum Entanglement

The constituents of quantum many-body systems may exhibit correlations that cannot be classically described, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.

# Machine Learning Quantum Many-Body Systems

Machine learning has proved to be a viable tool for the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Certain models have been shown to be more efficient for this task than more commonly used Monte Carlo algorithms.

# Accelerating Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation was invented in the 40's and many existing algorithms have been highly optimized already. Due to the ubiquity of these simulations in science, and other fields such as finance, it is of interest finding ways of accelerating this tool.
